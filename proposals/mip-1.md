Fantom is missing a music platform. 
Let's create a decentralized music platform for artists and perfomrers that incentivizes early supporters of these artists.
The immediate incentive to use this platform would be everything purchased would grant the rights to use the track/video/art
All content could be played in the background of videos/streams which would serve as a major benefit to content creators.
Currently, Strangebrew x HazHeat have partnered to create the Strange Brew Pub Jukebox Collection
Master Copies of new release tracks are auctioned at the Tombheads auction
The "Master Copy" provides ownership rights to the track and 10% royalties of the secondary mint.
There are 5k secondary copies at a price of 10 FTM.
Utility for secondary copies could be built into the decentralized music platform.
This project is looking to evolve into a ("Music Hall") decentralized music platform for the Fantom network to share together.
This would allow for copyright free blockchain radio stations 
Eventually, this could evolve into live virtual performances/concerts
This projects immediate needs are front end development and marketing
The Strangebrew x HazHeat Jukebox Collection is seeking a partnership through shared ownership of the project with the DAO
